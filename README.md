# Epicor-SQL-queries

Purpose: 
A central repository of SQL queries built to extract insigtful information about business processes. Some of these queries may be a bit tailored (for example, filter criteria based on a name), so sorry if it adds work on repurposing. 

If you know how to create a connection string to your Epicor database and have read permissions, drop these in an Excel MS Query data connection and see what happens! (None of these queries write or delete records I promise). What I like to do is pull it into VBA program and drop data where I need it. Just some ideas I guess. Anywhoo...
